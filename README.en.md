# 🌌 Parallel World - A Digital Memorial

## ✨ Project Vision

"Parallel World" is an open-source project that uses technology to commemorate the departed. We believe:

> "People are only truly gone when forgotten."

This is a digital memorial space for loved ones, friends, and pets who have left us but still live in our memories.

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Use blockchain technology to ensure memorial data **cannot be tampered with**
- Guarantee **permanent preservation** through decentralized storage
- Create **digital monuments** that transcend time and space
- Establish **emotional connections** between the living and the departed
- Keep the project free and open-source **without profit motives**
